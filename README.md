# Data Analysis with Pandas and SQL

This project involves data analysis using Python (with Pandas) and SQL(MYSQL). The goal of this project was to transform raw data into a more useful format, perform analysis using Python, and then store and query the transformed data with SQL.

## Project Overview

- Raw Data: The initial dataset containing unprocessed data.
- Modified Data: The data after it has been cleaned and transformed using Pandas in Python.
- SQL: SQL scripts to perform further analysis on the transformed data.

### Tools Used
- Python (Pandas): For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- MYSQL*: For querying and analyzing the cleaned data.
- Google Colab: For running Python scripts and performing data analysis in a collaborative environment.
- GitHub: For version control and project sharing.

### Files
- `Walmart.csv`: The original dataset before any modifications.
- `Walmart_new_data.csv`: The cleaned and transformed data after Pandas operations.
- `walmart_analysis.sql`: SQL script to perform analysis on the modified data.
- `walmart_sales_analysis.ipynb`: Python script demonstrating data manipulation using Pandas.

### Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation: The raw data was cleaned and transformed using Pandas in Python. This included:
   - Handling missing values
   - Renaming columns for clarity
   - Filtering and grouping data
   - Aggregating data for further analysis
2. SQL Analysis: The transformed data was loaded into a database (or used directly in a SQL query) to perform various queries and extract insights.
   - Used SQL to aggregate data and extract key metrics
   - Performed joins and filtering to create insightful reports
